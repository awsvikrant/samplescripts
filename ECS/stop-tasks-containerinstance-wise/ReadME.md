# Stop all-stop-tasks using aws cli. 

You can stop all tasks running on an ECS container instance using AWS ECS Management Console by click on stop-all button. As of now, this option is available only on console and I have written shell script which will help you to do this using AWS CLI. 

```
#stop-tasks-containerinstance-wise.sh default

```
